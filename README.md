# SudokuSolver
A console based soduko puzzle solver written in C.

## Description
This is a simple commandline-based utility to solve sudoku puzzles. The main code was originally developed for Project Euler #96, but has been repurposed to facilitate user entry of unsolved puzzles.

## Usage
SudokuSolver can be run in a terminal, and the user will be prompted to enter the incompleted sudoku puzzle 1 row at a time (9 digits), substituting unknown values for '0'. (eg `001060050`).

Alternatively, a puzzle may be redirected to SudokuSolver from a file, using this syntax: `./sudokuSolver < test.txt`
